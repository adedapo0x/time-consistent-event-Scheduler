basic demo project that keeps event times consistent across timezones

ever wondered why the same event shows up as 3 PM in Lagos but 10 AM in New York?

this project demonstrates how to build a lightweight backend and frontend app that:
- Stores all event times in UTC (universal truth)
- Converts them to user's local timezone when displaying
- Handles timezone changes seamlessly

frontend is deployed on Vercel and backend on Render
